Uh-huh, yeah hah 
Never Sprung huh? 
Jigga, Roc-a-Fella y'all 
Never Sprung huh? 
Yeah, peep the repertoire 
Peoples, feel me on this one 
Peoples, feel this 
Never Sprung huh? Know my style 
 
I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches 
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches 
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches 
Can't Knock Your Hustle for real, exotic bitches 
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french 
frames with the french name in the same night 
Pull you and your tight friend 
lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in 
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R 
Sexin in a Lexus car 
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all 
is like vege-tables in my presence, check it 
Reminescin to nuttin you ever heard, Iceberg 
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs 
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred 
Get money like I'm down South Wednesday the 3rd, it's on 
 
 [Chorus] 
Dough to get, more shows to rip 
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit 
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick 
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit 
 
Can't scheme on em, Roc-a-Fella got a team on em 
Chicks dream on him trick cream on him 
Lose it when dudes think it's just music 
Lean on em flash green on em and diamond rings on em 
Sex around the way girls down to mida's 
I'm somethin every girl gotta have like Levi's 
Chiquita, me got more, see I brawl 
You can love me or hate me, either or 
I'ma stay winnin, rock the custom drop Bentleys 
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil Penny 
can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave 
just as quick, indian give, ha-hah 
Now what I look like? Givin a chick half my trap 
like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin that 
you be the same chick when you leave me 
the bankbook and the credit cards and take everything you came wit chorus 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
Here's somethin niggaz gon find, not at all funny 
We takin all ya bitches, takin all ya money 
Jay-Z rated A.G. baby that's All Good 
I sink this ball in your hole, I'm Tiger Woods 
If the money was the grass and your ass was tee 
when I hit it with this club love you comin with me 
Grip you right up under your ass, put your back on the wall 
Kinda tipsy, seein triple, so I'm fuckin ya all 
You remind me of this dream I had the night before 
I'm kinda hopin the condom break to have a reason to go raw 
I'm playin, hit the showers, hit the money spot 
Where all the models play and big money is dropped 
Drop the top, let her feel the moonlight it entranced her 
She jumped all in my seat like some private dancer 
I tell you somethin new, if you don't hop down off that 
butter soft shit with your shoes, I'ma step on the gas 
She laughed, put her ass back in the proper place 
She said, 'I played my cards right and look I got the ace' 
I told her (beatboxes) 'Slow down baby' 
You dealin with a baller, who, hold ground crazy it's on 
 
 [Chorus repeat 4X] 
 
Beyatch! Fucka 
Jigga, nine-seven shit, next millenia 
Recognize, realize, it's on 
Roc the block y'all 
Laugh 
It's on
