H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins 
Got it dirt cheap for them 
Plus if they was short wit' cheese I would work wit' them 
Boy and we...got rid of that dirt for them 
Wasn't born hustlers I was burpin' em 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy 
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me 
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy 
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in 
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me 
Therefore he doesn't exist 
So poof...vamoose son of a bitch 
 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
That's the anthem get'cha damn hands up 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
Not guilty ya'll got-ta feel me 
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A 
 
Yo, It starts with 
One thing, I don't know why 
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 
It's so unreal 
I Didn't look out below 
I Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know 
Wasted it all just to 
Watch you go 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me, will eventually, be a memory, of a time when I tried so
