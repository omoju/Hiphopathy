[Kelly Price (Jay-Z)] 
Talking: Throughout my life (uh huh uh huh uh) 
no matter what I've done.(Right) 
You've been merciful and your love endureth (yeah) 
through all things (ye yeah) For that 
I am eternally grateful. 
 
 [Verse 1] 
Since my date of birth 
bought you nothing but hurt 
play those video games 
stole change from ya purse 
Sat on the cold court bench 
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt 
Saw the pain in ya face 
through you maintained a smirk 
All you did was motivate me 
don't let 'em hold you back 
What I do I turned around 
and I sold you crack 
I was a bastard for that 
still I'm drowning in shame 
Just remember one thing now 
you're not to blame 
You was newly seperated 
tryin' to escape ya world 
and through my thirst 
I didn't help you 
I just made things worse 
I hated me and everybody 
that created crack 
Had me thinkin' 
the newest kicks and the latest gat 
Still haven't apologized 
so please play this back 
while I try to come to terms 
with such a heinous act 
you know in more than one way 
cocaine numbs the brain 
All I did was think about 
how the funds once came 
then I ran across this memory 
and it stung the brain 
How can you ever destroy the beauty 
from which one came 
That's a savage you're the reason 
why me and these beats make a marriage 
why I rhyme above average and 
I ain't shit 
Glad you got yourself together 
no thanks to me 
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be 
You must love me 
 
 [Chorus (K. Price) (You must love me repeats in background)] 
Say that you love me 
All I know say that you must love me. 
Ohh yeah 
 
 [Verse 2] 
We used to fight every night 
but I never would suffer 
just smile my big brother's 
tryna make me tougher 
As we grew fussing and fighting continued 
as I plundered through ya stuff 
and snuck ya clothes to school 
Got intense real intense 
as we got older 
Never believed it would lead 
to be popped in one in ya shoulda 
Where my rings? Knew you had it 
'cause you took too long 
as Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on 
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand 
told you step outside 
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride 
made our way down the steps 
maybe you thought it was just a threat 
or maybe ya life was just that crazy 
and you was beggin' for death 
try to justify this in my young mind 
but ya drillin' it 
and my ego hurt combined 
drove me berzerk 
Saw the devil in your eyes 
high off more than weed 
confused I just closed 
my young eyes and squeezed 
What a sound 
opened my eyes just in time 
to see ya stumbling to the ground 
Damn what the fuck I done now 
runnin' around in a circle 
thinking I'm assed out 
hot gun burnin' my waist 
ran straight to Jazz' house 
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga 
and ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga 
Left the scene how could I go out that way 
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day 
You must love me. 
 
 [Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)] 
What after all the wrong I've done 
I know you must 
 
 [Verse 3 (Starts over last line of chorus)] 
Everything in my power and within my frame 
to protect you from this life and 
keep you away from the game 
But you was one of the few people 
that I can trust 
and the fact of the matter I slang 
these pies for us 
You put the pressure on me dearly 
rarely would you let it go 
Was a thousand and one times 
I had to tell you no 
When it was one of those days 
when nobody was around 
and I needed emergency trip 
out of town 
Searched my mental rolodex 
for all the numbers I know 
As you stared in my face 
asking me could you go 
I'm agreed said sender 
everything'll go smooth 
just tell her what to do 
and everything'll go through 
Strapped her body with them thangs 
as you boarded the plane 
Couldn't explain these strange feelings 
that I caught and the pain 
I'm thinkin' why would I send you 
when I knew it ain't right 
I'm thinkin' what would 
make you sacrifice ya life 
You must love me 
 
 [Chorus (You must love me repeats in background)] 
After everything that I've done wrong 
I know inside you must love me 
I know that you love me 
You showed me I know it 
I know 
Say that you love me 
say that you love me 
I know you must love me 
Oh yes you do 
Inside I know it 
you've always shown it 
you love me yea yeah 
Oh yeah 
I know that you love me
