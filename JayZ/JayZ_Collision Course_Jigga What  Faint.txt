Jigga what, Jigga who? 
Jigga what, Jigga who? 
Jigga what, Jigga who? 
 
You gon' need a vocal in, right? 
 
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit em wit, numerous 
shots with the fo'-fo' 
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke em like cocoa 
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload 
Fuck dat, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed 
Left holes through some guy clothes 
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip 
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit 
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip 
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit 
Oh hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you 
But see me I wanna Fuck for Free like Akinyele 
Now I gotta let her take this ride, make you feel it 
inside your belly, if it's tight get the K-Y Jelly 
All night get you wide up inside the telly 
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me 
 
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard 
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact that everyone can see 
these scars 
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel 
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe 
this is real 
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got 
 
Got a condo with nuttin but condoms in it 
The same place where the rhymes is invented 
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke 
See how I was flowin on my last cassette? 
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though 
Never get high, never run out of ammo 
Niggaz hatin n shit cause I slayed your bitch 
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick 
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war 
Don't know how to carry your hoe, wanna marry your hoe 
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be 
A pimp with a tragedy 
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends 
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again 
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "Shit.. 
there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!" 
 
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident 
Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make 
sense 
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt 
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear 
me out 
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I'm not 
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got 
 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
 
No 
Hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not 
Right now 
Hear me out now 
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not 
Right now 
 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
 
I can't feel the way I did before 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal this damage anymore 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
 
I can't feel 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored 
Time won't heal 
Don't turn your back on me 
I won't be ignored
