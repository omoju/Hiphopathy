Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind 
 
Now can I get an encore, do you want more 
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 
Now what the hell are you waitin for 
After me, there shall be no more 
So for one last time, nigga make some noise 
 
Get em Jay 
 
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that 
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at 
Can't none of y'all mirror me back 
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime 
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead 
Back to take over the globe, now break bread 
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express 
Out the country but the blueberry still connect 
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck 
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep 
Grand openin, grand closin 
God damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again 
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen 
just draw off inspiration 
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him 
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS 
 
Now can I get an encore, do you want more 
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy 
So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
 
Now what the hell are you waitin for 
After me, there shall be no more 
So for one last time, nigga make some noise 
 
What the hell are you waiting for 
 
 [sighs] Look what you made me do, look what I made for you 
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you 
When you first come in the game, they try to play you 
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you 
From Marcy to Madison Square 
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea) 
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears 
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye 
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5 
It ain't to play games witchu 
It's to aim at you, probably maim you 
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens 
Cocksucker take one for your team 
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing) 
I came, I saw, I conquered 
From record sales, to sold out concerts 
So muh'fucker if you want this encore 
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore 
 
I'm tired of being what you want me to be 
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface 
Don't know what you're expecting of me 
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
Every step that I take is another mistake to you 
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow) 
And every second I waste is more than I can take 
 
I've become so numb I can't feel you there 
I've become so tired so much more aware 
I'm becoming this all I want to do 
Is be more like me and be less like you 
 
I've become so numb 
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...) 
I've become so numb 
So for one last time I need y'all to roar 
One last time I need y'all to roar
