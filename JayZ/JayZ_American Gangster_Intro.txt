The theme song to (The Sopranos) 
plays in the key of life on my, mental piano 
Got a strange way of seein life like 
I'm Stevie Wonder with, beads under the doo-rag 
Intuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah 
Knowin I can go, just switchin a spare 
On the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight 
Oh! Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches 
everytime somebody like Enus was mentioned 
I would turn green, me, bein in the trenches 
Him, livin adventureous not worryin about expenditures 
I'm bravin temperatures below zero, no hero 
No father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga 
But I'm starvin my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure 
is startin to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver 
Watch it my niggaz, I'm tryin to be calm but I'm gon' get richer 
through any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture 
Never read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures 
Only psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz 
Tattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious 
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures 
Niggaz, say it's the dawn/Don but I'm superstitious 
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothin is goin as you predicted 
I move with biscuits, stop the harder niggaz actin too suspicious 
This is, food for thought, you do the dishes
