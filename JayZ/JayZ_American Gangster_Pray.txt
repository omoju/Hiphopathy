[Beyonce talking] 
Delivery me from my enemies oh god 
Defend me from those that rise up against me 
Deliver me from the work of inequities 
the savior from the blood of me 
 
 [Jay-Z - Verse one] 
look, mind state of a gangster from the 40's 
meet the vicious mind of Motown's Berry Gordy 
turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's 
sorry my jewelery so gordy 
slid into the party with my new pair of Maury's 
America meet the gangsta Shawn Corey 
hey young world wanna hear a story? 
close your eyes and you could pretend your me 
a cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's 
Frank Sinatra having dinner with the Genovese 
this is the genesis of a nemesis 
mother America's not witnessing 
the Harlem renaissance birthed black businesses 
this is the tale of lost innocences as the incents burn 
and the turn tables turn and that Al Greens plays 
i see my mother's afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays 
and my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my Uncle Ray 
and she's trying to calm my nerves, as i observe this is just one day 
and what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is 
Pray 
 
 [Beyonce Talking] 
Because of your strength 
while i walked upon the 
for god is my defense 
 
 [Jay-Z] 
as i head towards my home room I observe the rooms though needles on the ground 
I hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the BM with the top down 
as the girls start to giggle I ask why you laugh they say "you too little" 
one day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you 
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol 
fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful 
I didn't choose this life this life chose me 
around here is the shit that you just do 
I just left school, the same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue 
they had they guns drawn screaming just move 
unless there something else you suggest we can do 
he made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh 
a treasure chest was removed 
cops said he'll be back next month 
what we call corrupt he called paying dues 
now when the rules is blurred as they hears a what am I to do 
but pray, pray the lord forgive me 
pray guys goodbye for what I'm about go through 
Pray 
 
 [Beyonce Talking] 
Delivery me in thy righteousness 
it cause me to escape and climb thy air until i am 
Save me lord 
 
 [Jay-Z] 
anyway there's oppression the drug profession 
flourishes like beverages refreshing 
sweet taste of sin everything I've seen made me everything I am 
bad drug dealer or I victim I beg 
what came first moving chickens or the egg 
this is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life 
because I can't cheat death 
the truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is 
you know who's game this is 
move coke like Pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is 
I stand behind mine everything I do I'm a man behind mine 
I'm not a angel I'm sure but every night before I lay 
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray 
 
 [Beyonce Talking] 
The name shall endure forever 
The name shall continue as long as the sun will 
Men shall be blessed in him 
All nations shall call him blessed 
In your name I pray 
For you blessings
