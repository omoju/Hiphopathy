Oh... 
I like the party life... 
Break Out The Red Lights 
The city in bright lights 
Welcome To The Party Life 
These girls dressin' skintight... 
Welcome to the 70's--Sweet! 
 
Ordered some Patreezy 
While talkin' to this breezy 
Brushin' off my three-piece, I make this look too easy 
So tall and lanky, my suit? 
It should thank me 
I make it look good to be this hood, 
Meyer Lansky mixed with lucky lefty 
Gangster, effortlessly 
Poppa was a rolling stone-its in my ancestry 
I'm in a whole 'nother league, niggas never catch me 
And I sport fly shit, I should win the ESPY 
 
(Baby I, I said I sport fly shit, I should win the Espy.... 
I'm really in another league, babe....... 
I got a slick mouth, you might wanna roll with me,) 
 
I'm on her bra strap, she's on my dick 
Ain't nothin' wrong with that, that's my bitch 
I be the boss of that, I'm on her shit 
So all you niggas fall back, I'll split ya wig 
She's my little quarterback ....ya dig? 
Cause I'm all that in the sack ....ya, ya dig? 
I spoiled her 
Foiled it if you fakin', Jack 
She's used to million-dollar vacations 
Fuck you all gonna do with that? 
 
When you're blue 
You got nothin' to do 
(Ay, baby, see,.... 
When you're used to Filet Mignon,) 
Head into the party life 
(Its kinda hard to go back to Hamburger Helper...) 
If you're feelin' low 
We got to go 
(Its your choice though, baby....) 
Get into the party life 
 
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'? 
(Yeah, baby....) 
Is you headin' to the party life? 
(Is you rollin'? 
You can stall out or ball out....) 
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'? 
Is you headin' to the party life? 
(Make a choice.... 
Its so gangster, baby....) 
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'? 
 
Sippin' on my vino 
Got me cooler than Pacino 
When DeNiro put together my real life its like CASINO 
They should pay me for some B-roll 
Takin' G-strolls through the ghee-to 
When rap-p-p-pid fire's just a necessary evil 
Hola Hovito', cooler than zero 
B-low fresh one blade, no chemo 
Art with no easel 
Please, its no equal 
Ya boy's off the wall, these other niggas is Tito 
 
Oh... 
I like the party life 
The city in bright lights 
These girls dressin' skintight... 
(Damn,..... 
Ay baby, I said I'm, I'm Off The Wall, I'm like a... 
young Michael Jackson, these other niggas is Tito.... 
Shout out to Randy, Real Talk!) 
 
When you're blue 
You got nothin' to do 
(I'm gonna just let this ride out...) 
Head into the party life 
(I might let it ride out for like 7 minutes, you can groove to it, whatever) 
If you're feelin' low 
We got to go 
(Lets two-step....aaow!) 
Get into the party life 
(Guru, turn the lights down, lets keep it smooth... 
This that shit you roll up, like a little tight J to... 
Sip ya little wine...) 
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'? 
Is you headin' to the party life? 
Is you rollin' rollin' rollin'? 
Is you headin' to the party life? 
(whatever your vice is, you know? 
Whatever YOU like to do...get into yo' comfort zone, baby.... 
Get into yo' comfort zone.....uh huh) 
 
When you're blue 
You got nothin' to do 
(Head into the party life.....) 
Head into the party life 
If you're feelin' low 
We got to go 
(I don't even want it to stop, tho, forreal tho...) 
Get into the party life 
 
Step into my bedroom 
I call it the Red room 
C-cause it gets h-h-hot-t-t 
I trust you gonna like it 
See, why are we talkin' all this fly shit? 
C-c-c-c-cause I'm the flyest 
Hovito, baby 
No equal, baby 
So, petite n' gold 
Let the beat go 
Now I'm eatin' gold, baby 
Hovito, baby 
No equal, baby 
So, petite n' gold 
Let the beat go 
Now can we go crazy?.... 
(Ooh!!!......) 
 
When you're blue 
You got nothin' to do 
Head into the party life 
If you're feelin' low 
We got to go 
Get into the party life..... 
 
(Yo...nothin' in the world makes me sadder than to see a lonely girl....)
