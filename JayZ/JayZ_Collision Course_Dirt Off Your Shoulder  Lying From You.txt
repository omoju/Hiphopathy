I ordered a frappuccino 
Where's my fuckin frappuccino 
Alright, let's do this 
 
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be 
I look exactly like what you always wanted to see 
When I pretend, I can't forget about the criminal I am 
Stealing second after second just cause I know I can but 
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay I'm just 
Trying to bend the truth 
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be, so I'm 
Lying my way from 
 
If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you 
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 
 
I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force 
Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche 
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced 
Middle finger to the law, nigga grip'n my balls 
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin 
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin 
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin 
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it 
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots 
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block 
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block 
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc 
 
If you feelin like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off 
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off 
Niggaz is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you 
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder 
 
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder 
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder 
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder 
You gotta get (get), that(that), dirt off your shoulder 
 
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda 
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover 
Tryin to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir 
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya 
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin 
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em 
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling 
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin 
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve 
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen 
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean 
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real, chill 
 
Yeah, I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that and this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in 
And now you think this person really is me and I'm 
Trying to bend the truth 
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away 'cuz I'm 
 
Lying my way from you 
No no turning back now 
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go 
No no turning back now 
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone 
No turning back now 
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see 
No no turning back now 
The very worst part of you 
The very worst part of you is ME 
 
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me 
Like This 
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me 
Like This 
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me 
Like This 
This isn't what I wanted to be, I never thought that what I said would 
have you running from me

You 
No turning back now 
I wanna be pushed aside so let me go 
No no turning back now 
Let me take back my life I'd rather be all alone 
No turning back now 
Anywhere on my own cuz I can see 
No no turning back now 
The very worst part of you 
The very worst part of you is me
