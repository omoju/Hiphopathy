Uh-huh uh huh uh 
Gee-gee-geyeah 
Baby, watchin, streets 
Uh-huh uh huh uh 
You don't have to look 
Uh-huh uh 
The streets is watching 
Check it, check 
Uh-huh uh, check 
 
Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless 
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a nigga to do? 
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking 
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake 
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted 
But my time is money, at twenty-five, I can't afford it 
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates 
niggaz you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it 
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass 
This rhyme, you're operating on fuck time 
Y'all niggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggaz 
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale 
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops 
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop 
Would I rather be on tour getting a, hundred a pop 
Taking pictures with some bitches, in front of the drop 
The streets is watching 
 
 [Chorus] 
When the, streets is watching 
Blocks keep clocking 
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake 
Can't ignore it 
 
Now it's hard not to kill niggaz 
It's like a full time job not to kill niggaz, can't chill 
the streets is watching you, when you froze your arms 
niggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm 
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up 
Sweet niggaz running 'round swearing shit is sweeter 
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader 
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer 
Kidnap niggaz wanna steal ya 
Broke niggaz want no cash, they just wanna kill ya 
for the name, niggaz don't know the rules 
Disrespectin the game, want you to blow your cool 
Force your hand, of course that man's plottin 
Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
My street mentality flip bricks forever, know me and money 
we like armed co-defendants, nigga we stick together 
Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground 
Hustle harder to see if indictment time came around 
Now you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found 
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now 
Got a face too easy to trace, niggaz mouths got slow leaks 
Had to hide between my workers, couldn't play those streets 
She got his face like Mercury you jerkin me? Hectic 
Had to call upon my wolves to send, niggaz the message 
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here 
I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare' 
Hey there's money to be made and, niggaz got the picture 
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer 
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff 
had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant 
I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time 
in my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me 
Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that? 
I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back 
like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad 
Was niggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack? 
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack 
and knock a lot like two trains that's on the same track 
'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back 
In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot 
Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop 
Set up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan 
For three straight weeks, niggaz slaughtered the block 
But you know the game is 'lluted, fucked up me and my dues 
One drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops 
and this unstable way of living just, had to stop 
Half of my niggaz got time, we done real things 
By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggaz rhymes 
Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street 
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets 
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime 
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind 
I figured, 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes 
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine' 
The mindstate, of a nigga who boosted the crime rate 
so high in one city they send National Guards to get me 
Ya dig? 
 
The streets
