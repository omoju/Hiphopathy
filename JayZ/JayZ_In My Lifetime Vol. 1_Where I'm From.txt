Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah 
ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah 
How real is this, how real is this 
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check 
 
 [Verse One:] 
I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come 
You and your man's hung in every verse in your rhyme 
where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer 
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run 
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set 
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet 
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets 
So I felt some more something and you nothing check 
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much 
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much 
So they ran up Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust 
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us 
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgetable 
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new 
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do 
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it 
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about 
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas 
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are 
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars 
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's 
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars 
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars 
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all 
 
 [Chorus: 5x] 
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice 
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own 
 
 [Verse Two:] 
I'm from the place where the chruch is the flakiest 
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist 
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow 
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday 
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells 
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale 
Your laughing, you know the place well 
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well 
And Government, fuck Government, niggas polotic themselves 
Where we call the cops the A-Team 
cause they hop out of vans and spray things 
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen 
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies 
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize? 
If the shit is lies, god strike me 
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me? 
We'll never know 
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know 
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto 
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done 
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice 
 
 [Chorus 4x] 
 
 [Verse Three:] 
I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards 
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen 
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street 
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet 
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep 
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet 
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed 
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat 
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with 
Three dice and shoot the five 
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips 
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this 
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist 
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this 
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs 
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood 
 
 [Chorus 4x]
