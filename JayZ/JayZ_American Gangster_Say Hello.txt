It's that Rocafella music.... 
Soulful... 
 
 [Chorus:] 
Say hello 
To the bad guy 
Hello 
They say I'm a bad guy 
I come from the bottom 
But now I'm mad fly 
Say Hello 
They say I'm a menace 
That's the picture they paint 
Hello 
They say a lot about me 
Let me yell ya what I ain't 
Hello 
They say I'm a bad guy 
Say Hi to the bad guy 
Hello 
I come from the bottom 
But now I'm mad fly 
They say I'm a menace 
That's the picture they paint 
They say a lot about me 
Let me tell ya what I ain't 
Say hello 
Hello 
Ay, ay, ay, ay 
They say a lot about me 
Let me tell you what I ain't 
 
I ain't playing, 
Life's short, so I aimed 
I ain't waiting for life to start portrayin' em 
Its twice as hard to get a job that's paying 
So I ain't payin' attention to what you saying 
Rain-drops keep falling on my brain 
Constant in the drop, all flames 
I'm so hot even if the weather change 
I don't have no top, I'm insane 
Remember darkskinned Jermaine? 
Suede in the rain, I'm sorta kinda the same 
Except I'm no lame and you gonna know my name 
Before I go to work and feel my pain 
Saying, I'm a bad guy, why's that? 
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga, I react 
Secretly though, I know you admire that 
You wish you had the balls to fire back-- 
Say hello, uh, uh, hello, uh. uh 
You wish you had the balls to fire back 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
I ain't no ordinary nigga 
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets you 
Extraordinary figures 
I'm an extra-ordinary nigga 
Before my name became Jigga 
Before I sang, I had that thang on sippers 
Can't complain bout what they ain't gonna give ya 
That ain't gonna get you shit, might as well give up 
Or get up, get out and get something, nigga 
Get a job, my nigga, or get to dumping 
Only God can judge him, only he without sin 
Can tell me if my means can justify my ends 
Til' then, I'm just gonna fly in the Benz 
Wire my friends through Western Union 
Shh....surprising my sister, knockin' 
Here comes the bad guy again! 
Say hello 
Uh uh 
Hello 
uh uh 
Hello 
Here comes the bad guy again 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
We ain't thugs for the sake of just being thugs 
Nobody do that where we grew at, nigga, DUH! 
The poverty line, we not above 
So out come the mask and glove cause we ain't feelin' the love 
We ain't doing crime for the sake of doing crime 
We movin' dimes cause we ain't doin' fine 
One out of three of us is locked up doing time 
You know what that type of shit can do to a nigga mind? 
My mind on my money, money on my mind 
If you owe me ten dollars, you ain't giving me nine 
You all ain't give me 40 acres and a mule 
So I got my Glock 40, now I'm cool 
And if Al Sharpton is speaking for me 
Somebody get him the word and tell him I don't approve 
Tell him I'll remove the curses 
If you tell me our schools gonna be perfect 
When Jena 6 don't exist 
Tell him that's when I'll stop saying bitch---BITCH! 
 
 [Chorus]
