[Jay-Z:] 
I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it 
Let that bitch breathe! 
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less 
What do I think of success 
It sucks too much to stress 
I guess I blew up quick, cause friends I grew up with 
See me as a primi, but I'm not and my nut's big 
I don't know what the fuss is 
My career is illustrious 
My rep is impeccable 
I'm not to be fucked with, with shit 
Let that bitch breathe! 
I'm way too important to be talking extorting 
Asking me for a portion is like asking me for a coffin 
Broad daylight I off ya on switch 
Ya not too bright, goodnight, long kiss, 
Bye-bye, my reply, blah-blah 
Blast burner then pass burner, to TyTy 
Finish my breakfast, why? 
I got an appettite for destruction and you're a small fry 
Now where was I 
Let that bitch breathe! 
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more 
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor 
I'm pissed off, is this what success all about 
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths 
All this stress, all I got is this big house 
Couple cars, I don't bring half of them shits out 
All this ace of spade I drank, just to piss out 
I mean I like the taste, could have saved myself six hours 
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu 
Hold up, let me move my bowels 
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys 
 
 [Juan:] 
Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga 
 
 [Jay-Z:] 
I got watches I ain't seen in months 
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in it once 
Nigga said Hova was over, such dummies 
Even if I fell I land on a bunch of money 
Y'all ain't got nothing for me 
Nas, let that bitch breathe! 
 
 [Nas:] 
Success, McLaren, women starin' 
My villain appearance 
Sacred blood of a king 
In my vein ain't spillin' 
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill, Romero 
Camaro driven 
I climax from paper then ask why is life worth livin' 
Is it the hunt for the shit that you want 
To receive is great but I lust giving 
The best jewelers want to make my things 
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine, just to make me a chain 
Niggas mention of one love, came home to paper in hand 
Ain't got to brag about the feds young man 
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments 
Google Earth Nas, I got flats in other continents 
Worst enemies want to be my best friends 
Best friends want to be enemies, like that's what's in 
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den 
Take everybody's chips, about to cash them in 
Up your catalogue dog, mines worth too much 
Like Mike Jack's ATV Pub, Mottola can't touch 
Let this bitch breathe! 
 
 [Jay-Z & Nas:] 
Let this bitch breathe!
