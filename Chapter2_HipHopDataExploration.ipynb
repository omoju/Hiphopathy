    "Welcome to an innovative way of teaching and sharing the delights that comes when data, computational methods and culture collide. The goal of this lab is to connect cultural relevance to computing by introducing elementary techniques of natural language processing with a corpus of hip-hop data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Art is something that we often believe that is separate from the so-called hard sciences. As a result, those of people who are gifted in the arts or are inclined in that direction, shy away from the sciences because many fall prey to the false choice of choosing between the arts or the sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to change this false dichotomy by bringing the power of computational methods to investigate and explore the riches that are inherent in the arts. It is for this reason that we have chosen to use a corpus of hip-hop lyrics as the dataset on which we will practice our computational techniques. At the end of this lab you will be able to build a visualization of the occurrence of certain words in a rap corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons why Python is loved is that it is a language that lends itself well to things like building webapps as well as ``hardcore\" computational science like calculating the orbits of planets and stuff like that. What we are interested in, is doing a bit of data manipulation based on a hip-hop corpus. We are going to be doing something similar to what Matt Daniels did with the hip-hop vocabulary. We are going to get under the hood and create our own hypothesis.\n",

For the sake of If you read the article, you will see that Matt used the first 35,000 lyrics of each artist.

On the other hand, you can actually use the rap annotation site genius(http://rap.genius.com/) to get all that information and then some. According to Genius, Jay Z has a lot of songs. On average, most rap songs are usually set with 3 verses containing sixteen bars, or sixteen sentences each. \n",

I need to figure out how many words are in the average rap bar?\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to solve this we need to basically find every instance of Jay Z's lyric, scrape them off the Internet, and then start number crunching on them. To make this process faster, I have already built something called a webscraper and scraped all his lyrics till the Holy Grail album. Hopefully that gives us more than enough data to get to 35,000 words.\n",

    "The lyrics I scraped off the Internet have been compressed in the zip file named `JayZ.zip.' Go ahead an unpack this file to our PythonDataLab folder. Take a look inside, you will see its made up of a bunch of text files. Take sometime and go through some the text file to see what they look like.

The `create_corpus` function that we used, works by separating each contiguous chunk of alphabets separated by punctuations or space as a word. As a result contractions like \"I'm\" gets treated as two words. We can use the function `lexical_diversity` to determine the number of unique words in our Jay Z corpus."

So why do we even need to “normalize” terms? We want to match <b>U.S.A.</b> and <b>USA</b>. Also when we enter <b>roll</b>, we would like to match <b>Roll</b>, and <b>rolling</b>. One way to do this is to stem the word. That is, reduce it down to its base/stem/root form. As such <b>automate(s)</b>, <b>automatic</b>, <b>automation</b> all reduced to <b>automat</b>. Most stemmers are pretty basic and just chop off standard affixes indicating things like tense (e.g., \"-ed\") and possessive forms (e.g., \"-'s\"). Here, we'll use the most popular english language stemmer, the Potter stemmer, which comes with NLTK. \n",
