[Verse One: Jay-Z] 
Peep the scripts 
Gold honey from the whips 
Jumped out like YO! 
Who the fuck you with 
Flash the juice 'cause that's the rule 
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes *** 
Natural - Can I get at you? 
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo 
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun 
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon 
I said I never seen a face like yours before 
And I been around some cute whores before 
That either me or my boys tore it up before 
So I'm hoping you different 
Let you push the 6 
And give you a different life and 
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning 
And ride it 'til the night 
Want to buy you real jury when it hits the light 
Bitches are momentarily lose they sight 
She said 
 
 [Chorus:] 
I know what boys like 
I know what they want 
I know what boys like, boys like 
I know what boys like 
I know what they want 
I know what boys like, boys like me 
 
 [Verse Two: Lil' Kim] 
So want a cutie with a booty like OW! 
Deeper than the MOW! 
Airy Shine like TADOW! 
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things 
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it? 
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet 
Marvel Forts is for matching Rolls Royce's 
In the driveway from Monday to Friday 
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches 
While chickens cluck giving up the butt 
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff 
You can call me a slut 
Who gives a fuck 
That's fine nigga shit 
I'm a good with mine 
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want 
Fuck a prenup give me half up front 
My sex be the best so we split these costs 
You can stop saying mine 
And start saying ours 
 
 [Chorus:] 
I know what girls like 
I know what they want 
They want to sex me 
They think I'm sexy 
I know what girls like, girls like me 
 
I know what boys like 
I know what they want 
They want to sex me 
They think I'm sexy 
I know what boys like, boys like me 
 
 [Verse Three: Jay-Z] 
Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze 
Victoria Secret lingerie 
Ice like Don King 
The price was like 8 digits a long way, shit 
Got the beachfront view 
V1 too 
Cop you one cop me one too 
On the place, jetski's park by the lake 
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make 
Invite your friends over 
Better make their way through 
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door 
Vacate, hey wait, a week or more 
First class to and fro, freakin off 
Got the ham things lot 
Champaigne popped 
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop 
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot 
Can't complain, we balling, true or not? 
 
 [Chorus: 2x] 
I know what girls like 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like, girls like 
I know what girls like 
I know what they want 
I know what girls like, girls like me 
 
I know what boys like 
I know what they want 
I know what boys like, boys like 
I know what boys like 
I know what they want 
I know what boys like, boys like me
