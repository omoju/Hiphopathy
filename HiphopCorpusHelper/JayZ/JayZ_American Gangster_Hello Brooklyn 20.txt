[Chorus - Lil Wayne:] 
Hello Brooklyn how you doing? where you going? can I come too 
And if I can I'm a be your man you could be my lady 
And have my baby and drive my cars and drive me crazy 
Wherever you going baby girl just take me 'cause I'm so taken 
If you taken I'm just sayin' baby I'm just sayin' 
 
 [Jay-Z] 
Like a momma you birth me Brooklyn you nursed me schooled me wit Hard knocks better than Berkeley 
they say you murked me by the time I was 21 that shit disturbed me but you never hurt me Hello 
Brooklyn if we had a daughter guess what I'm a call her Brooklyn Carter when I left you for 
Virginia it didn't offend your 'cause you no I only stepped out to get dinner and now I'm eating so
