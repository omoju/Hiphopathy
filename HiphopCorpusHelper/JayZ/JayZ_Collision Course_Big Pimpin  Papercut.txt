Ha Ha 
You're wasting your talent, Randy 
 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right 
 
Why does it feel like night today? 
Something inside's not right today. 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left 
I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head 
Like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall 
And watches everything 
 
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right beneath my skin 
 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right 
 
You know I - thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em 
Cause I don't fuckin need em 
Take em out the hood, keep em lookin good 
But I don't fuckin feed em 
First time they fuss I'm breezin 
Talkin bout, "What's the reasons?" 
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch 
Better trust than believe em 
In the cut where I keep em 
til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts 
Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up 
Let em play with the dick in the truck 
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs 
Divorce him and split his bucks 
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread 
so you can be livin it up? Shit I.. 
parts with nothin, y'all be frontin 
Me give my heart to a woman? 
Not for nothin, never happen 
I'll be forever mackin 
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion 
I got no patience 
And I hate waitin.. 
Hoe get yo' ass in
