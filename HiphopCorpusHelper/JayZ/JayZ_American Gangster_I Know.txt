Uh- 
She wants that old thing back 
Uh- uh- uh- 
She want those Heroin tracks 
She likes me 
She fiends for me nightly 
She leans for me 
Morning she rush for my touch 
This is about LUST 
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her 
My presence is a must- must- must- 
Bonita Applebum, i gotta put you on 
If i didn't when we cuttin' the feeling would be too strong 
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams 
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing 
That Black Rain that take away your pain 
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein 
Now that feelin' got you trippin' 
You no wanna feel no differently 
Said lust has got you itchin' 
Nose wide open and its' drippin' -eh -eh -eh -eh 
I know what you like, i am your prescription 
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction

I am so DOPE 
Like Louboutin's with the red bottoms 
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em 
Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me 
Its so much fun, you shun therapy 
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting 
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it 
I'm never around, you constantly seek it 
You'll never be down, i know where your peak is 
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps 
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself 
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!" 
Like you better get help 
But when that medicine's felt? 
We're back together 
Don't ever leave me 
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me 
My China White, 'til we D.O.A. 
Its Montego forever, baby, lets get away....

How could you leave me? 
I thought that you needed me! 
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me-- 
Who helped you immediately? 
How speedy of me! 
How could you deny me so vehemently? 
Now your body is shakin' trying to free it of me 
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me 
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me 
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D
