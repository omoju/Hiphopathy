Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back 
Liver bad he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back 
Guidance I never had that, streets was my second home 
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at 
A place to study math at, matter fact I learned it all 
Burnt it all this music is where I bury the ashes at 
Flash back not having much, not having that 
Had to get some hollerest you can holla back at 
Holla that my Jewish lawyer do enjoy the fruit of within my cash stack 
Just in case a nigga got to use his rat-ta-ta-ta-tat 
Own boss own yawt, masters, slave 
The mentality I carry with me to this very day 
Fuck rich let's get wealthy who else gonna feed we 
If I need it I'm gonna get it however God help me 
 
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!!) 
 
I'm so for sure is known for sure 
Stay out of trouble, momma said as momma sighs 
Her fear her youngest son being victim of homocide 
But I got to get you out of here momma or I'm gonna -- die 
Inside -- and either way you lose me momma so let loose of me 
I got the rain our direction'll soon change 
To live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game 
Hustle cane, hustle clothes or hustle music 
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick 
Skinny nigga toothpick but, but I do lift 
Weight like I'm using roids Rolls Royce 
Keep my movements smooth while maneuvering 
Through all the manuers in the sewers that I grew up in 
Choices we make trying to escape 
 
(And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!) 
 
This is not for commercial usage 
Please don't categorize this is music 
Please don't compare me to other rappers 
Compare me to trappers I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris 
And Luda's my dude I ain't trying to diss 
Like Frank Lucas is cool but I ain't trying to snitch 
I'm gonna follow the rules no matter how much time I'm gonna get 
I'm gonna live and die with the decisions that I'm gonna pick 
So fuck the haven for cave in, that's why we don't speak 
Made men ain't supposed to make statements 
End of the story I followed the code cracked the safe 
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate 
Leave that boy Hov alone why don't you 
You don't have to if you don't want to but don't say I didn't warn you 
 
Oh (And I don't need no hook for this shit!!!)
