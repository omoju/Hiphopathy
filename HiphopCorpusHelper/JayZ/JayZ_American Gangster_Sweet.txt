[1st Verse:] 
Sweet! 
And still there's pain 
If I would have grew up to be a doctor, my nephew would have grew up to do the same 
But since I grew up through the game, and my influence is the same 
And my therapy is music, they ask if you ashamed 
And though I wish I could separate, two things, 
I cannot, so my answer to you remains 
I can walk down the hall or mirrors, in Versailles 
And be so satisfied when I look a myself in the eyes 
No shame, no sir, just big boats and tearing the coast up 
Tight coup like I'm wearing the roadster, 
For any coup I'm bear hugging the holster. 
 
 [Chorus:] 
Hov, alright, alright 
And that may not be 
What you call perfect 
But, but it's my life 
The life, the life, the life 
Once again it's the life 
 
 [2nd Verse:] 
So I make no apologies 
Crooked policies 
So a G a nigga gotta be 
We playing for property, no monopoly 
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me 
They say the child shall lead, 
So I take it far as I can, and then we shall see 
Shall we dance with the devil, for a beat 
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet 
Do the hustle, put keys in the street 
Then I'm ballroom dancing, ke-ke'ing in the suite 
Sweet. 
BB's on the feet, TV's in the seat 
Enemies on the creep 
It's so corrupt 
Soak it up 
It's a lesson, never fuck up 
One day you're up, next day you're down 
Long as you stay the same, it will come back around 
 
 [Chorus] 
 
 [3rd Verse:] 
I'm even better, I'm eating better 
Best thing about it is, my niggas eating together 
With each endeavor 
We reaching levels, niggas ain't seen in like forever 
I'm hyman roth I make all my partners rich 
I can vouch for you, if you ain't a part of this 
So pardon me as I pave my wrist 
As I parlay my chips, Hov! 
Alright, alright, American Gangster, ganster, business like I'm white 
But I'm not, I'm just bright 
So fly with no fear of the flight 
So if y'all hear my plight 
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight 
Couple mistakes here and there, not always right 
But I'm always real, that's how I sleep at night 
 
 [Chorus]
