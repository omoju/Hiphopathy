I'm from the 80's, 
Home of the heroine, 
Error of the hustlers, uh 
The world is my custy 
New rich porter 
The way I flip quarters 
Front on all these other rap artists, but me 
Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers 
So it's plain to see, where my whole plan come from 
American dream, I'm living the life still 
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill 
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining 
40 below timbs on, getting my M's on 
My best friends gone, I seen bad days 
Still find songs that I hear him on 
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on 
I hear his voice in my mind, like, nigga live on 
So I get on that fly shit I been on 
Spin on corners in enzo with rims on 
But for info, puffin on Endo-Nesia 
Give me amnesia 
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga 
I want the sky, 
The world when I'm done 
I'm give it to my sons 
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, 
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done 
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names 
I came, if the sky should fall 
And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars 
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the beamer 
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina 
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club 
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love 
Now they wanna ya boy like Mike in his prime 
Billie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine 
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope 
Can't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes 
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's 
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo 
Rose gold rose flow, I'm okay though 
What Don't kill me makes stronger than before so 
Here we go and I'm not domino 
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw 
I might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand 
Yeah that's my goal 
And then I bid you Freddy Adu 
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the future 
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle 
My name will be viewed such 
Here's to the man that refused to give up 
I want the sky nigga, Chuuuuuuch
