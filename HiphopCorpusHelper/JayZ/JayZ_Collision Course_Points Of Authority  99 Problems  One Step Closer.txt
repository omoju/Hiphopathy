Got Mike 
He's got the rap patrol on the gat patrol 
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed 
Rap critics that say he's "Money Cash Hoes" 
He's from the hood stupid what type of facts are those 
If you grew up with holes in your zapitos 
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin doe 
So fuck critics you can kiss our whole asshole 
If you don't like my lyrics you can press fast forward 
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show 
They don't play out hits well we don't give a shit SO 
All these mags try and use our ass 
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads...fuckers

I'm from rags to ritches nigga we ain't dumb 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son

The year is '94 and in my trunk is raw 
In my rear view mirror is the mother fuckin law 
I got two choices yall pull over the car or 
Bounce on the double put the pedal to the floor 
Now i ain't tryin to see no highway chase with Jay 
Plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case 
So i...pull over to the side of the road 
And i heard "Son do you know why i'm stoppin you for?" 
Cause i'm young and i'm black and my hats real low 
Do i look like a mind reader sir, i don't know 
Am i under arrest or should i guess some mo? 
"Well you was doin fifty five in a fifty four" 
"Liscense and regestration and step out of the car" 
"Are you carryin a weapon on you i know alot of you are" 
I ain't steppin out of shit all my papers legit 
"Do you mind if i look round the car a little bit?" 
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk and the back 
And i know my rights so you gon' need a warrent for that 
"Aren't you sharp as a tack are some type of lawyer or something?" 
"Or somebody important or somethin?" 
Nah i ain't pass the bar but i know a little bit 
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit 
"Well see how smart you are when the K-9's come" 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me 
 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

Hit me

If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Now once upon a time not too long ago 
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe 
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy 
But a pussy havin no God Damn sense, try and push me 
I tried to inore him and talk to the Lord 
Pray for him, cause some fools just love to perform 
You know the type loud as a motor bike 
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight 
The only thing that's gonna happen is i'mma get to clappin 
He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain 
And there i go traped in the kit kat again 
Back through the system with the riff raff again 
Fiends on the floor scratchin again 
Paparatzi's with they cameras snappin them 
D.A. tred to give the nigga the shaft again 
Half-a-mil for bail cause i'm African 
All because ths fool was horrasin them 
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccarin 
But ain't nothin sweet 'bout how i hold my gun 
I got 99 problems but this bitch ain't one 
 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one 
Hit me 
99 Problems but a bitch ain't one 
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son 
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
