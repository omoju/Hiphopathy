Roc-a-fella records 
The imperial Skateboard P 
Great Hova 
Y'all already know what it is (Oh Shit!) 
 
C'mon! 
 [Verse 1] 
Yeah 
So what if you flip a couple words 
I could triple that in birds 
open your mind you see the circus in the sky 
I'm Ringling brothers Barnum and Bailey with the pies 
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfucking guy 
Just like a B-Boy with 360 waves 
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige. 
Whether right or south paw, whether powder the jar 
Whip it around, it still comes back hard. 
So easily do I w-h-i-p 
My repetition with wrists will bring you kilo biggers. 
I got creole C.O. bitches for my niggas who slipped, became prisoners 
Trees taped to the visitors 
You already know what the business is 
Unnecessary commissary, boy we live this shit 
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back 
It's OK with me, that's where they made me at 
Except I don't write on the wall 
I write my name in the history books, hustling in the hall (hustling in the hall) 
Nah, I don't spin on my head 
I spin work in the pots so I can spend my bread 
 
 [Chorus (Pharrell):] 
And I'm getting it, I'm getting it 
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it 
I'm getting it, straight getting it 
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy 
(Don't waste you time, fighting the life stay your course, and you'll understand) 
Get it boy 
 
 [Verse] 
It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in) 
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim) 
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in 
But I wouldn't be the guy whose rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in) 
No pain, no profit, P I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is) 
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back) 
Red and green G's all on my hat 
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater 
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together 
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain 
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game 
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster 
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra 
I ran contraband that they sponsored 
Before this rhyming stuff we was in concert 
 
 [Chorus (Pharrell)] 
 
 [Verse 3] 
Push (push) money over broads, you got it, fuck Bush 
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked 
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books 
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took 
Feds, they like wack rappers, tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook 
D.A. wanna indict me 
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces 
The Pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves 
Turn one into two like a Siamese 
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man never dying on my knees 
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop 
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block 
 
 [Chorus (Pharrell)]
